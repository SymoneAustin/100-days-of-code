# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 27: February 26th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made the contact me section of my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** It took a surprisingly long amount of time to stylize the form for my contact me section. A friend told me about a easy to use form so people can email you. It was easy to set up but to get it to look the way I wanted, took more time than I expected. I also created a footer for my site that has my social media links. I also put a copyright so people know I am the one who slaved over this lol. Tomorrow I am going to focus on creating the pages for each of my projects.

### Day 26: February 25th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made the projects section of my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how quickly I'm building my site. I think I am going to beat my schedule. Which is great because the sooner I finish it, the sooner I can show it to employeers. Bootstrap is getting easier and easier to use. The only catch is that I still don't know all of the classes. But that's what Google is for right?

### Day 25: February 24th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I practiced more jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I went back to Codecademy to practice jQuery. I am 16% done with the course. It isn't hard, I think because I did Javascript first so it makes it easier to understand.

### Day 24: February 23rd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I finished building the skills section of my site. I think I am started to get the hang of Bootstrap. The hardest is just knowing which class is the best choice for your particular need. But I was able to get everything arranged the way I wanted it. I just need to work on the size of the text.

### Day 23: February 22nd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I finished building the home and about me screens. Bootstrap definitely has a learning curve. The concept is easy enough to understand but there are some many classes that you can use. It is hard to know all of them and it makes it frustrating when you know there is a way to do something, you just do know the correct class for it. Thank the good man upstairs for Google!

### Day 22: February 21st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started building my online portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I am building it from scratch and I am using Bootstrap to make it responsive. I got the opening screen done tonight. I just need to figure out how to change the color of the links in the navbar. I'm sure I just have to find the right class...

### Day 21: February 20th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I jumped over to jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I went back to Codecademy to be introduced to jQuery. I went through the first course pretty quickly. It is like a shorter version of Javascript. The lesson said most people learn jQuery first and then move to Javascript, opps! But anyway I made a button that changed opactity as you hovered over it. It was actually pretty simple. I just have to get used to the syntax.

### Day 20: February 19th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the flexbox method.

**Thoughts:** I learned about flexbox in the fall and the concept was hard for me to grasp. I would basically just randomly choose diffent properties until something worked and it took me forever to do the simplest of things. Then I found out about this website called wwww.flexboxfroggy.com. It's a game where you have to place frogs on lilly pads using flexbox. It really explains the different properties used with display:flex and breaks it down for you. I was able to finish all 24 levels of the game. It was actually fun and now I feel more confident with flexbox. Thomas Park here on github made it. Thanks Thomas!

### Day 18&19: February 17th-18th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Responsive Design with Bootstrap section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I'm sure using it in an actual project will be more complex but I really enjoyed using Bootstrap. I want to use it on my protfolio I am creating. I want the site to be parallax and I plan on using skrollr. I hope I can use skrollr and Bootstrap at the same time. We shall see! But for now i'll keep on practicing coding. I want to do this thing called flexbox froggy. It is a game that teaches you how to use flexbox.

### Day 17: February 16th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML5 & CSS section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I revisited the basics of HTML and CSS. I needed the review. My brain has been so Javascript focused I needed the refresher. I also learned some new concepts. Like how browsers pay respond to the order of css styles. Browsers read from top to bottom, so how you write your CSS styles matters. If you give an element two color classes, it will show the last class that you wrote. The browser listens to ids over classes. Inline style changes top ids and classes. If you write !important next to a CSS style that tops everything. I start Bootstrap tomorrow which I'm super excited about because I plan to use it on my personal portfolio.

### Day 16: February 15th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started the Front End Development Certification on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I want to complete that certification, not by the end of the challenge but at some point in the future. I used FCC a few months back for school but I only did the basic Javascript part. I want to do the whole thing this time. Alot of it was review. The basic HTML & CSS section is supposed to take 5 hours, I'm halfway through after 1 hour whil watching tv. But I did learn some new elements like forms and inputs. I'm excited to see the difference between FCC and Codecademy.

### Day 15: February 14th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I am 100% done with the Javascript course on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I feel so accomplished not that I finished the course. This last project only had 7 problems to solve but they didn't have detailed hints so it was really up to you to figure it out. It got harder as you progressed through the project (building a cash register) and I ended up having to use Google to figure out the last 3 problems. But I was proud of myself because I knew why the code wasn't working, I just didn't know the exact syntax. I am finally understanding the concepts I just need to practice more. I finished Codecademy so tomorrow I'm jumping over to Free Code Camp. Hopefully it's a smooth transition.

### Day 14: February 13th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I am 96% done with the Javascript course on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I learned about public and private variables and methods. After I finished my lesson today, I completed two quizes that ut my knowledge of Javascript to the test. The first quiz had 15 questions and I only missed 1. The last quiz had 29 questions and I missed 4. This proves that I actually am learning this concepts and rules which is exciting!

### Day 13: February 12th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about prototypes and inheritance in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Prototypes are used so multiple classes can have the same methods. The syntax looks like this: className.prototype.newMethod = function() {}; Inheritance is used so one class can have the same methods as another.

### Day 12: February 11th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued my lesson on Javascript on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I had an early morning and I long day but I spent a couple hours making some progress on the Javascript path. One of the things I learned is the way to find out if an object has a vaule ( obj.hasOwnProperty(prop) ).

### Day 11: February 10th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I built an address book with Javascript on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** The lesson was going smoothly until the last section. I felt like I was doing everything right but it wouldn't accept my answer. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I brainstormed for 20 minutes trying to get it right. Eventually I realized what was wrong... I used equal signs instead of a colon. -_____________-

### Day 10: February 8th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished a course on Codecademy and now I'm 80% done with Javascript!

**Thoughts:** It seemed like it took me forever to get through that last course. I've been working after midnight so I couldn't ask customer service for help. So all I had was Google (every coders best friend). I am learning alot I just want to make sure I remember everything. I guess I won't know if I'll remember until I work on an actual project. But I don't think I'm ready yet.

### Day 9: February 7th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about methods in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot of new things in Javascript. I can't wait to apply them to a real project. I just hope I don't forget everything when I do a project.

### Day 8: February 6th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed a lot of the basics of Javascript.

**Thoughts:** It is hard for me to remember all of the syntaxs for the basic thinns in Javascript. I still have to do more practing! Also I have started to memorize the difference between literal notation and constructor notation for objects.

### Day 7: February 5th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a contact list using Javascript and I was able to search for different names on the list.

**Thoughts:** Javascript is frustating!! You have to have the syntax just perfect or it won't work. I also get confused when to use certain things. I still learning about objects and creating functions. I like challenges though and I won't give up until I figure this out.

### Day 6: February 4th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I confinued to work on object constructor nontation.

**Thoughts:** I was frustated because Codecademy wouldn't appect my syntax, but I'm pretty sure it was right...

### Day 5: February 2nd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I was introduced to objects today.

**Thoughts:** Initially the object constructor notation was confusing. But I got the syntax down.

### Day 4: February 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made another game with Javascript and learned a lot about switch.

**Thoughts:** The concept of switch is pretty easy to understand.

### Day 2: January 30th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a game using Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still learning about Javascript. Learning the rules isn't so hard, the tricky part is learning when to use them. It's calculus all over again!

### Day 1: January 29th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about while loops in Javascript.

**Thoughts** For the beginning of this challenge I want to develop a better understanding of Javascript. Hopefully Codecademy will help me learn.
