# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 51: April 4th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 more algorithm problems on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I returned the largest number in each sub array of an array, confirmed if the last letter in a string was the same as a different argument, and repeated a string as many times determined by the argument "num". For the first problem, i used a for loop (arrayIndex) inside another for loop (subArrayIndex). Then I had an if statement saying if the sub array is bigger than the other numbers in the sub array. Then the second problem. I used the str.substr(-target.length) property checked to see if it was equal to the target.  For the last problem I used an if/if/else statement (the num had to be positive) and the .repeat() property.

### Day 50: April 2nd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 algorithm problems on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I checked for Palindromes (words that are spelled the same forwards or backwards, i.e. "racecar"), found the longest word in a string, and capitalized every word in a string. What I am finding is that there are multiple ways to solve every problem. I needed help to complete the problems. I am starting to understand the flow of Javascript, it's really just a logic game. The more problems I do the better I will get. I realized I like thinking of solutions that involve a for loop or if/else statements. Hopefully I will be able to finish a problem by myself soon.

### Day 49: March 30th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Jumped back to jQuery on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** Taking a mental break from FreeCodeCamp and switched to jQuery on Codecademy. The lesson was pretty easy. I learned about different event handlers in jQuery (.click(), .dblclick(), .hover(), .keydown()) and how to use them to get make things move. I can see myself using it for projects.

### Day 48: March 29th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started the algorithm challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Whoa. So I only did two of them. The first one I am proud to say I figured out on my own. I reversed a string. Yay me lol! The second was to factorialize a number. That one was more tricky. I had to use the read,search,ask method to figure it out. Completeing these basic algorithms is probably going to be the most difficult coding I've had to do thus far. But I'm excited to learn!

### Day 47: March 28th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished object oriented & functional programming on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** This section was pretty easy. I was able to do it in one night. I learned some new methods though. ".join" lets you combine all of the elements in an array into a single string. ".split " divides a string into an array. ".concat" merges 2 arrays into one. ".reverse" reverses the order of an array. ".sort" sorts the elements in an array alphabetically or numerically. ".filter" filters out certain elements in an array that are not true according to a given condition. ".reduce"  goes through an array and condenses it into one value. ".map" goes through an array and can create a new array based off your callback function. This was a lot of new information. I understood it as I was going through the lesson, I just hope I can retain everything. Tomorrow I start the algorithm challenges. I am excited to put my new skills to the test.

### Day 46: March 27th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic Javascript on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm done! I am so happy that I understand Javascript more. I remember last semester when I struggled so much with this course. Now I flew by most of the problems. Only a few stumped me (50% of the time because I used a comma where it shouldn't be). Tonight the Profile Lookup question gave me trouble and I had to Google for help. I think the important part is I'm understanding the theory behind each problem. Even if I don't get the answer 100% on my own, I'm understanding the logic so I can do better the next time.

### Day 45: March 25th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on basic Javascript on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've been on Spring Break and that really messed up my productivity. I went to Philly and NYC and was just too busy during the day. But spring break is over now and I'm back! I continued working on freecodecamp and I only have 12 more lessons to do before I complete the basic javascript section.

### Day 44: March 19th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on basic Javascript on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I only have 23 questions left. I had one that gave me some issues today. It was the counting cards question. I had to write code for the game Blackjack. I figured out that I needed a switch to describe the values of all the cards. But then I wanted to do an if/else statement to say if the count is greater than 0, then say Bet. If it was 0 or less then say Hold. But it did not work completely. It didn't work for if the count was equal to 0. So I google and found another way that I don't completely understand. They used this... " return count + (count > 0 ? " Bet" : " Hold");" Now I need to figure out what a ternary operator is...

### Day 43: March 18th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on basic Javascript on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I traveled to Philly over the last 2 days so I missed yesterday. But I the hotel I managed to get an hour in. I just finished the Golf Code question. I am so happy because I remember doing that question last semester and I struggled. But this time I did it on the first try, it was so easy!

### Day 42: March 16th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on basic Javascript on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I have 51 more lessons until I am finished with this section. Today was mainly focused on arrays. I got stuck on the "stand in line" lesson. I thought I was on the right track but my answer was still wrong. I found a forum to get some help. I realized that I was extremely close to the right answer! I just had one line of code that was redundant so it wouldn't work. This makes me feel good because it means that I am learning. My thought process was correct which is the important thing. I'm excited to keep going.

### Day 41: March 15th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Attended my first meetup.

**Thoughts:** I went to a meetup to learn about Git and Github. I am so glad I went. It was my first time and I was slightly intimidated but it was actually really fun and people were nice. Plus, they had pizza! So, git is a type of version control system that you use through the terminal. There are 3 branches of Git: Working directory, staging area and the head. All your main files are in the working directory. When you make a change, they move to the staging area. When you are certain you like the change, you commit the file to the head and your changes appear in your file. The committed files are in the "master branch". The files you use for testing are in the "test" branch. Github is a platform for open source projects. You can upload a project to Github. Then someone can fork your project, clone it, and pull it down to their computer with the help of the terminal. They can make changes using Git, commit those changes in the terminal and they will be shown in their Github files. From there, they need to pull a request to the original creator of the project. Then the creator can decided if they want to use those changes.

### Day 40: March 14th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 1st 36 lessons of basic javascript of FCC.

**Thoughts:** I am redoing the basic javascript section on FCC. When I did it last semester I didn't understand everything and needed alot of help. I learned some new concepts after the section on Codecademy so I am hoping I can understand it better the second time around. I moved pretty quickly tonight but I got stuck on the "word blanks" section. I had to set a variable to a collection of strings to form a complete sentence. But I could not get it working so I went to the chat for help. They helped me figure it out (I forgot to put spaces before and after each string) but I didn't enjoy using the chat room. It was filled with men and I was the only woman. I just felt like they were judging me for not understanding. I hope this isn't a reflection of the entire industry.

### Day 39: March 13th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd front end dev project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** This time I had to build a portfolio and it took me a little more time than the first project. But it was still relatively easy since I just spent the last few weeks working on my actual portfolio. The tricky part was getting used to the code pen platform. Many of my elements refused to center on the page. It took a while before I realized it was because the "col-xs-12" was useful in code pen. I had to change it to "col-lg-12". Also it was hard to determine the height of the div since it height of the window can constanly change on code pen.

### Day 38: March 11th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Back to Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I went back to working on my jQuery section on Codecademy. I am 25% done.

### Day 37: March 10th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started and finished the 1st basic front end dev project.

**Thoughts:** I must say it was pretty easy. I had to build a tribute page. Which was just h1, p, and ul tags. Then I styled it with some CSS and Bootstrap. But it's funny to think that 8 months ago I would have taken me forever to complete.

### Day 36: March 9th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Back to Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I finished the jQuery section of FCC. Looking forward to moving to the basic front end dev projects.

### Day 33-35: March 6th - 8th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished my portfolio!

**Thoughts:** I took a couple days off because I was going crazy from seeing media queries! But I am finally at a point where I am happy with my portfolio. I made it from scratch and I used Bootstrap as a framework. I'm proud of what I accomplished!

### Day 31 & 32: March 2nd - 3rd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made media queries. Lots of them.

**Thoughts:** So I discovered that Bootstrap (a framework that is designed to make your website responsive) did not make it responsive. At least not good enough for my standards. There are multiple devices that need tweaking. I spent 5.5 hours straight yesterday building media queries, just to find that somehow they were affecting the desktop version! Today instead of going through all my code to find where I went wrong, I started over. So far the desktop version is right and so is an iPad in portrait or landscape view. Tomorrow I will focus on different versions of the iPhone.

### Day 30: March 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made the pages for each project.

**Thoughts:** Most of the pages are for websites. One is for a video and one is for an app redesign. The video was the hardest to create. YouTube won't let you just copy the link, if you do it won't show on your site (which I had to learn the hard way). You have to use an iframe.

### Day 28 & 29: February 27th-28th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I fixed responsive issues and made a smooth scroll on the header.

**Thoughts:** I realized I was only halfway utilizing the Bootstrap grid system when I started building my portfolio. That is why some of my page wasn't responsive. With Bootstrap, you have to design with mobile first. So let's say you want three pictures to be in a row on a desktop but you want them stacked on a phone. Then you would use the classes .col-xs-12 .col-md-4. Always put the class for the smallest device first. Also notice I put "md" instead of "lg" for the second class. That is because Bootstrap know if you need it that way for "md" it will be the same for "lg". So put the smallest device and it will apply it to the bigger devices as well. 

The smooth scroll was really easy to make. Bootstrap allows you to do it with a line of Javascript. Now when you click a link in the navbar, it scrolls down to the appropriate section. Nifty.

### Day 27: February 26th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made the contact me section of my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** It took a surprisingly long amount of time to stylize the form for my contact me section. A friend told me about a easy to use form so people can email you. It was easy to set up but to get it to look the way I wanted, took more time than I expected. I also created a footer for my site that has my social media links. I also put a copyright so people know I am the one who slaved over this lol. Tomorrow I am going to focus on creating the pages for each of my projects.

### Day 26: February 25th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made the projects section of my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how quickly I'm building my site. I think I am going to beat my schedule. Which is great because the sooner I finish it, the sooner I can show it to employeers. Bootstrap is getting easier and easier to use. The only catch is that I still don't know all of the classes. But that's what Google is for right?

### Day 25: February 24th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I practiced more jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I went back to Codecademy to practice jQuery. I am 16% done with the course. It isn't hard, I think because I did Javascript first so it makes it easier to understand.

**Link to work:** 
https://twitter.com/SymoneAustin/status/835384163633090560

### Day 24: February 23rd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I finished building the skills section of my site. I think I am started to get the hang of Bootstrap. The hardest is just knowing which class is the best choice for your particular need. But I was able to get everything arranged the way I wanted it. I just need to work on the size of the text.

### Day 23: February 22nd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I finished building the home and about me screens. Bootstrap definitely has a learning curve. The concept is easy enough to understand but there are some many classes that you can use. It is hard to know all of them and it makes it frustrating when you know there is a way to do something, you just do know the correct class for it. Thank the good man upstairs for Google!

https://twitter.com/SymoneAustin/status/834662648365072384

### Day 22: February 21st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started building my online portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I am building it from scratch and I am using Bootstrap to make it responsive. I got the opening screen done tonight. I just need to figure out how to change the color of the links in the navbar. I'm sure I just have to find the right class...

### Day 21: February 20th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I jumped over to jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I went back to Codecademy to be introduced to jQuery. I went through the first course pretty quickly. It is like a shorter version of Javascript. The lesson said most people learn jQuery first and then move to Javascript, opps! But anyway I made a button that changed opactity as you hovered over it. It was actually pretty simple. I just have to get used to the syntax.

### Day 20: February 19th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the flexbox method.

**Thoughts:** I learned about flexbox in the fall and the concept was hard for me to grasp. I would basically just randomly choose diffent properties until something worked and it took me forever to do the simplest of things. Then I found out about this website called wwww.flexboxfroggy.com. It's a game where you have to place frogs on lilly pads using flexbox. It really explains the different properties used with display:flex and breaks it down for you. I was able to finish all 24 levels of the game. It was actually fun and now I feel more confident with flexbox. Thomas Park here on github made it. Thanks Thomas!

### Day 18&19: February 17th-18th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Responsive Design with Bootstrap section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I'm sure using it in an actual project will be more complex but I really enjoyed using Bootstrap. I want to use it on my protfolio I am creating. I want the site to be parallax and I plan on using skrollr. I hope I can use skrollr and Bootstrap at the same time. We shall see! But for now i'll keep on practicing coding. I want to do this thing called flexbox froggy. It is a game that teaches you how to use flexbox.

### Day 17: February 16th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML5 & CSS section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I revisited the basics of HTML and CSS. I needed the review. My brain has been so Javascript focused I needed the refresher. I also learned some new concepts. Like how browsers pay respond to the order of css styles. Browsers read from top to bottom, so how you write your CSS styles matters. If you give an element two color classes, it will show the last class that you wrote. The browser listens to ids over classes. Inline style changes top ids and classes. If you write !important next to a CSS style that tops everything. I start Bootstrap tomorrow which I'm super excited about because I plan to use it on my personal portfolio.

### Day 16: February 15th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started the Front End Development Certification on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I want to complete that certification, not by the end of the challenge but at some point in the future. I used FCC a few months back for school but I only did the basic Javascript part. I want to do the whole thing this time. Alot of it was review. The basic HTML & CSS section is supposed to take 5 hours, I'm halfway through after 1 hour whil watching tv. But I did learn some new elements like forms and inputs. I'm excited to see the difference between FCC and Codecademy.

### Day 15: February 14th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I am 100% done with the Javascript course on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I feel so accomplished not that I finished the course. This last project only had 7 problems to solve but they didn't have detailed hints so it was really up to you to figure it out. It got harder as you progressed through the project (building a cash register) and I ended up having to use Google to figure out the last 3 problems. But I was proud of myself because I knew why the code wasn't working, I just didn't know the exact syntax. I am finally understanding the concepts I just need to practice more. I finished Codecademy so tomorrow I'm jumping over to Free Code Camp. Hopefully it's a smooth transition.

### Day 14: February 13th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I am 96% done with the Javascript course on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I learned about public and private variables and methods. After I finished my lesson today, I completed two quizes that ut my knowledge of Javascript to the test. The first quiz had 15 questions and I only missed 1. The last quiz had 29 questions and I missed 4. This proves that I actually am learning this concepts and rules which is exciting!

### Day 13: February 12th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about prototypes and inheritance in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Prototypes are used so multiple classes can have the same methods. The syntax looks like this: className.prototype.newMethod = function() {}; Inheritance is used so one class can have the same methods as another.

### Day 12: February 11th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued my lesson on Javascript on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I had an early morning and a long day but I spent a couple hours making some progress on the Javascript path. One of the things I learned is the way to find out if an object has a vaule ( obj.hasOwnProperty(prop) ).

### Day 11: February 10th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I built an address book with Javascript on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** The lesson was going smoothly until the last section. I felt like I was doing everything right but it wouldn't accept my answer. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I brainstormed for 20 minutes trying to get it right. Eventually I realized what was wrong... I used equal signs instead of a colon. -_____________-

### Day 10: February 8th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished a course on Codecademy and now I'm 80% done with Javascript!

**Thoughts:** It seemed like it took me forever to get through that last course. I've been working after midnight so I couldn't ask customer service for help. So all I had was Google (every coders best friend). I am learning alot I just want to make sure I remember everything. I guess I won't know if I'll remember until I work on an actual project. But I don't think I'm ready yet.

### Day 9: February 7th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about methods in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot of new things in Javascript. I can't wait to apply them to a real project. I just hope I don't forget everything when I do a project.

### Day 8: February 6th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed a lot of the basics of Javascript.

**Thoughts:** It is hard for me to remember all of the syntaxs for the basic thinns in Javascript. I still have to do more practing! Also I have started to memorize the difference between literal notation and constructor notation for objects.

### Day 7: February 5th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a contact list using Javascript and I was able to search for different names on the list.

**Thoughts:** Javascript is frustating!! You have to have the syntax just perfect or it won't work. I also get confused when to use certain things. I still learning about objects and creating functions. I like challenges though and I won't give up until I figure this out.

### Day 6: February 4th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I confinued to work on object constructor nontation.

**Thoughts:** I was frustated because Codecademy wouldn't appect my syntax, but I'm pretty sure it was right...

### Day 5: February 2nd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I was introduced to objects today.

**Thoughts:** Initially the object constructor notation was confusing. But I got the syntax down.

### Day 4: February 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made another game with Javascript and learned a lot about switch.

**Thoughts:** The concept of switch is pretty easy to understand.

### Day 3: January 31st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about control flow.

**Thoughts:** Still with the Javascript.

### Day 2: January 30th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a game using Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still learning about Javascript. Learning the rules isn't so hard, the tricky part is learning when to use them. It's calculus all over again!

### Day 1: January 29th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about while loops in Javascript.

**Thoughts** For the beginning of this challenge I want to develop a better understanding of Javascript. Hopefully Codecademy will help me learn.
