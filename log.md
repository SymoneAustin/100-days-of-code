# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 30th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a game using Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still learning about Javascript. Learning the rules isn't so hard, the tricky part is learning when to use them. It's calculus all over again!

**Today's Progress**: I learned about while loops in Javascript.
