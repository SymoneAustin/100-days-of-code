# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: February 12th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about prototypes and inheritance in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Prototypes are used so multiple classes can have the same methods. The syntax looks like this: className.prototype.newMethod = function() {}; Inheritance is used so one class can have the same methods as another.

### Day 12: February 11th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I continued my lesson on Javascript on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** I had an early morning and I long day but I spent a couple hours making some progress on the Javascript path. One of the things I learned is the way to find out if an object has a vaule ( obj.hasOwnProperty(prop) ).

### Day 11: February 10th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I built an address book with Javascript on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** The lesson was going smoothly until the last section. I felt like I was doing everything right but it wouldn't accept my answer. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I brainstormed for 20 minutes trying to get it right. Eventually I realized what was wrong... I used equal signs instead of a colon. -_____________-

### Day 10: February 8th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I finished a course on Codecademy and now I'm 80% done with Javascript!

**Thoughts:** It seemed like it took me forever to get through that last course. I've been working after midnight so I couldn't ask customer service for help. So all I had was Google (every coders best friend). I am learning alot I just want to make sure I remember everything. I guess I won't know if I'll remember until I work on an actual project. But I don't think I'm ready yet.

### Day 9: February 7th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about methods in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot of new things in Javascript. I can't wait to apply them to a real project. I just hope I don't forget everything when I do a project.

### Day 8: February 6th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed a lot of the basics of Javascript.

**Thoughts:** It is hard for me to remember all of the syntaxs for the basic thinns in Javascript. I still have to do more practing! Also I have started to memorize the difference between literal notation and constructor notation for objects.

### Day 7: February 5th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a contact list using Javascript and I was able to search for different names on the list.

**Thoughts:** Javascript is frustating!! You have to have the syntax just perfect or it won't work. I also get confused when to use certain things. I still learning about objects and creating functions. I like challenges though and I won't give up until I figure this out.

### Day 6: February 4th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I confinued to work on object constructor nontation.

**Thoughts:** I was frustated because Codecademy wouldn't appect my syntax, but I'm pretty sure it was right...

### Day 2: January 30th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a game using Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still learning about Javascript. Learning the rules isn't so hard, the tricky part is learning when to use them. It's calculus all over again!
