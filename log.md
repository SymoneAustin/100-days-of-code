### Day 8: February 6th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed a lot of the basics of Javascript.

**Thoughts:** It is hard for me to remember all of the syntaxs for the basic thinns in Javascript. I still have to do more practing! Also I have started to memorize the difference between literal notation and constructor notation for objects.

### Day 7: February 5th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a contact list using Javascript and I was able to search for different names on the list.

**Thoughts:** Javascript is frustating!! You have to have the syntax just perfect or it won't work. I also get confused when to use certain things. I still learning about objects and creating functions. I like challenges though and I won't give up until I figure this out.
