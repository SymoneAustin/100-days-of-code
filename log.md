# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: February 5th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a contact list using Javascript and I was able to search for different names on the list.

**Thoughts:** Javascript is frustating!! You have to have the syntax just perfect or it won't work. I also get confused when to use certain things. I still learning about objects and creating functions. I like challenges though and I won't give up until I figure this out.

**Today's Progress**: I confinued to work on object constructor nontation.

**Thoughts:** I was frustated because Codecademy wouldn't appect my syntax, but I'm pretty sure it was right...

### Day 2: January 30th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a game using Javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still learning about Javascript. Learning the rules isn't so hard, the tricky part is learning when to use them. It's calculus all over again!
